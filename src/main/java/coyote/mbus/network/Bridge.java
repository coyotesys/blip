/**
 * The Bridge class models a component that manages a TCP connection to another 
 * node. 
 * 
 * <p>Object of this class maintain all state for the session.</p> 
 * 
 * <p>EVERYTHING BELOW IS BEING REFACTORED<br/> 
 * =========================================================================== 
 * <p>The source address of each incoming packet is checked to see if it 
 * matches any nodes on the bus subnet. If there is a match the packet is 
 * discarded.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Bridges listen to "join" and "leave" announcements and only bridge 
 * packets that match the current active membership list on either end of the 
 * connection. This reduces the number of packets that cross the bridges.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Before a bridge is created, the MicroBus attempts to see if there are any
 * other bridges to the subnet by sending a "ROUTE" packet to the bus with the
 * address of the destination node. Any node on the bus with a bridge to the 
 * subnet containing the destination address will respond with a "BRIDGE" 
 * packet indicating a bridge exists to the destination. If a BRIDGE packet is
 * not received in a timely fashion (TBD) the requesting node will open a 
 * bridge to the destination address and issue a BRIDGE packet announcing the 
 * new connection to others.</p>
 * 
 * <p>When a bridge is established to the destination, the remote systems send 
 * their respective subnet mask to the other end, allowing each end of the 
 * bridge to announce the availability of the bridge to their local bus 
 * neighbors. The BRIDGE announcement can then be checked by others to sense 
 * routing loops.</p>
 * 
 * <p>All JOINs and LEAVEs are propagated across bridges allowing multi-hop 
 * bridging to occur based upon group name while throttling bridge traffic.</p> 
 * 
 * TODO NIOSESSIONSERVICE is the model 
 * TODO Negiotiate session-level QoS - like IAM/EAM, priority, encryption, authentication, etc. 
 * TODO Use the ClosureMessage object to signal disconnect.
