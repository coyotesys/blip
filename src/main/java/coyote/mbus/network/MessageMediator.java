/**
 * Message Mediators send and route packets over some transport medium.
 * 
 * <p>Object of this class handle incoming packets received from transport media 
 * and send packet frame over said same. This provides a single interface that
 * represents a transport medium like TCP/UDP, file systems, databases, third
 * party messaging systems like JMS and vendor-specific mediators.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The sequence of packets is some MessageMediator receives raw data from it's
 * medium, as in the network. This raw data is converted into Packets and
 * often passed to an Object that handles the exchange of Packets with other
 * entities in the medium. This is handled most often by objects of the
 * RemoteNode class. These protocol entities make the decision to either
 * generate Packets that are passed back to the MessageMediator for routing to
 * channels it manages, or to generate Packets that get sent back over the
 * medium to affect protocol dialog. In short, this interface is used by the
 * Packet protocol handlers to talk to other Packet protocol handlers or
 * to allow the transport to route Packets to its clients.</p>
