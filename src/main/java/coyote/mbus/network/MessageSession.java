/**
 * MessageSession runs in its own thread and performs all network IO for a 
 * MessageSession. 
 * 
 * <p>Objects of this class maintain a connection to another MessageSession or 
 * similar service in order to affect event operations. It is this class that 
 * provides dedicated network communications to reliably pass events between 
 * systems or a client and an event mediation system.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Since TCP is used as a transport, it is assumed that all events will 
 * arrive in their proper order and there is no need to cache transmitted 
 * messages for possible NAKs from the receiver.</p>
 * 
 * <p>TCP connections will be re-established if the "restart" flag is set to 
 * true which will cause the run() method in the ThreadJob class to loop back 
 * up to the initialize method. The initialize method will notice the socket 
 * exists and will assume this is a subsequent initialization and attempt a 
 * reconnection.</p>
 * 
 * <p>As far as dispatching of events go, all MessageSessions run in their own 
 * thread and take events off the socket channel as fast as possible. When an 
 * event is received, it is placed in the MessageChannel.</p>
